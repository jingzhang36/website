This guide explains the Kubeflow Pipelines [benchmark scripts](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/tools/benchmarks)
and demonstrates how to use them to collect basic performance data of a given
Kubeflow Pipelines deployemnt.

## Before you start

To use the provided benchmark scripts, you will need a Jupyter notebook instance
and that instance should have access to the Kubeflow Pipelines API server.

## Overview

Those benchmark scripts simulate typical workloads, apply them to the Kubeflow
Pipelines API server, and record the server latencies and run durations under
the workloads.
